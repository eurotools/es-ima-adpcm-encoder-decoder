### Features
This tool can be used to encode 16-bits PCM Wav files to the IMA ADPCM Format, and vice-versa. 

It is only compatible with headerless IMA ADPCM files, so, to decode an IMA file is required to know previously the frequency and the number of channels to avoid undesired results when decoding.
